Use FSR_Analog for simple data acquisition of FSR readings while testing.

Use FSR_withLight for the prototype.  This code turns on indicator red and green LED lights depending on the FSR reading in a binary system.  Depending on which pin (on the sides) you wire the LED's into, you can change:
  int redLED = 13; // change this line to the right pin # connecting the red LED
  int greenLED = 10; // change this line to the right pin # connecting the green LED
Leave everything else the same.
